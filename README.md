FastCGI implementation in pure Rust.

The focus is on the webserver/client side, but the application/server side could be added in the future.

Developed for [FlashRust Webserver](https://github.com/User65k/flash_rust_ws)
with focus on
- Vectorized IO and Zero Copy
- async IO / tokio
- easy [HTTP](https://crates.io/crates/http) interfaces

Tested with:
- Flup (Python)
- PHP

`cargo run --example webserver --features="con_pool"`

# Features

- [x] Handle UnixStream and TCPStream transparently
- [x] reconnect to the FCGI App if a connection is closed
- [x] Start an FCGI server (exec + env)
- [x] Support Key-Value Pairs bigger than maximum record size
- [ ] "Full Duplex" connection to the FCGI Server/App (e.g stream STDIN and OUT at the same time)
- [ ] `con_pool` should handle more than one connection :sweat_smile: and load balance
- [ ] A dropped `FCGIBody` should not block a RequestID and cancel the request
- [ ] `Connection` should handle overload error from FCGI app
- [ ] Parsing for FCGI application/server side

PullRequests are welcome BTW
